## Read

* [Of men, women and witches](https://www.amazon.in/Witches-Jeyamohan-Translated-Sangheetha-Puthiyedath/dp/9353453437)
  + ⭐⭐⭐⭐
  + First time reading a translation of Jeyamohan. Was quite skeptical given the
    depth and incisiveness of his language. Pleasantly surprised at finding
    myself hearing the book in Jeyamohan's voice in my head. The first chapter /
    section of the book is fantastic. The latter is less so in comparison to the
    first part, but wonderful on their own. This memoir brings together
    different strings that I've read and listened to in many of Jeyamohan's
    writings and speeches.
* Nov 2024, [I have the Streets](https://www.penguin.co.in/book/i-have-the-streets/)
  + ⭐⭐⭐⭐
  + Sweet little book that will connect with anyone who's grown up in TN in the
    90s, watching and playing cricket. Insight into the mind and madness of R
    Ashwin. 
* Oct 2024, [The Golden Road](https://www.amazon.in/Golden-Road-Ancient-India-Transformed/dp/140886441X)
  + ⭐⭐⭐
  + Least favourite Dalrymple. Enjoyed parts of it. Some of the parts borders on
    propaganda. The Buddhist history (early chapters) are much better than the
    latter.
* Aug 2024, [What I Talk About When I Talk About Running](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_I_Talk_About_When_I_Talk_About_Running)
  + ⭐⭐⭐⭐
  + Reads like a breeze. Captures the essence of a long-distance runner's mind.
    Draws parallels between the writing and running; discomforting solitary
    activities that one does not because they enjoy it, but because they have
    to. See [தன்மீட்சி – தன்னறம்](https://www.vishnupurampublications.com/product/thanmeetchi/).
* Aug 2024, [The Psychology of Money](https://www.amazon.in/Psychology-Money-Morgan-Housel/dp/9390166268)
  + ⭐⭐⭐⭐
  + Essential reading for 30 somethings.
* May 2024, [இந்து ஞான மரபில் ஆறு தரிசனங்கள்](https://www.vishnupurampublications.com/product/hindugnanamarabilaarudharisanangalvp/)
  + ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
  + Opinionated introduction to the [six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_philosophy#%C4%80stika).
* Apr 2024, [தன்மீட்சி – தன்னறம்](https://www.vishnupurampublications.com/product/thanmeetchi/)
  + ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
  + See [Svadharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svadharma).
  + Something to be re-read every few months.
* Feb 2024, [ஆலம்](https://www.vishnupurampublications.com/product/aalamnovel/)
  + ⭐⭐⭐
  + Lacks the depth of Jeyamohan's usual writing. That it was written as the
    source script for TV series is telling.
