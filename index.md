<img src="assets/profile.jpeg" alt="ProfileImage" style="width: 220px; float:
left; padding-right: 1rem; padding-left: 0.5rem; padding-top: 0.4rem;"/> I am an
Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering department at Indian
Institute of Technology, Madras. I work on the intersection of Programming
Languages and (Concurrent, Parallel, Distributed) Systems. 

I was a Senior Research Associate under the [OCaml
Labs](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs/) initiative at the [University
of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/) [Computer Lab](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/),
an [1851 Research Fellow](http://www.royalcommission1851.org/awards/) and a
Research Fellow at [Darwin College, Cambridge](https://www.darwin.cam.ac.uk/).
Earlier, I was a [graduate student](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/chandras/)
at [Purdue University](http://www.purdue.edu/) where I obtained an MS and a PhD
degree in Computer Science under the supervision of the wonderful [Prof. Suresh
Jagannathan](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/suresh/). Before that, I obtained
my BEng degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [Anna University,
India](https://www.annauniv.edu/).

I lead the development of [Multicore
OCaml](https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-multicore), a concurrent and parallel
extension of the OCaml programming language, which is slowly but surely being
merged upstream. I write about my research in my [blog](http://kcsrk.info/blog/)
(though not as often as I would like to).
