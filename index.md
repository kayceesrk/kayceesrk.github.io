<img src="assets/profile.jpeg" alt="ProfileImage" style="width: 180px; float:
right; padding-right: 0.5rem; padding-left: 0.5rem; padding-top: 0.4rem;"/> I am
an Assistant Professor in the [Computer Science and
Engineering](http://cse.iitm.ac.in/) department at [Indian Institute of
Technology, Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) and the Chief Technology Officer of
[Tarides](https://tarides.com/). I am interested in building robust, secure and
scalable systems using programming language technology.

I led the development of [Multicore
OCaml](https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-multicore), a concurrent and parallel
extension of the OCaml programming language. Multicore OCaml is now
[merged](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10831) into OCaml, and is available
for general use in OCaml 5.0. Effect handlers introduced as part of the
concurrency story of Multicore OCaml has had influence on the design of [React
Hooks](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#what-is-the-prior-art-for-hooks)
and [WebAssembly stack switching](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3622814).

I've co-founded several companies

* [Tarides - France](https://tarides.com/)
* [OCaml Labs Consultancy - UK](http://ocamllabs.io/) _(joined Tarides)_
* [Segfault Systems - India](https://segfault.systems) _(joined Tarides)_

<p/>
to build systems that are _functional_, and functional programming in
[OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) turns out to be a fine choice for this.

Earlier, I was a Senior Research Associate under the [OCaml
Labs](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs/) initiative at the [University
of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/) [Computer Lab](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/),
an [1851 Research Fellow](http://www.royalcommission1851.org/awards/) and a
Research Fellow at [Darwin College, Cambridge](https://www.darwin.cam.ac.uk/).
Earlier, I was a [graduate student](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/chandras/)
at [Purdue University](http://www.purdue.edu/) where I obtained an MS and a PhD
degree in Computer Science under the supervision of the wonderful [Prof. Suresh
Jagannathan](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/suresh/). Before that, I obtained
my BEng degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [Anna University,
India](https://www.annauniv.edu/).

I write about my research in my [blog](http://kcsrk.info/blog/)
(though not as often as I would like to).
