<img src="assets/profile.jpeg" alt="ProfileImage" style="width: 180px; float:
right; padding-right: 0.5rem; padding-left: 0.5rem; padding-top: 0.4rem;"/> I am
the Chief Technology Officer of [Tarides](https://tarides.com/) and an Adjunct
Professor in the [Computer Science and Engineering
department](http://cse.iitm.ac.in/) at [Indian Institute of Technology,
Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/). I am interested in building robust, secure and
scalable systems using programming language technology. 

I led the development of [Multicore
OCaml](https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-multicore), a concurrent and parallel
extension of the OCaml programming language. Multicore OCaml is now
[merged](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10831) into OCaml, and is available
for general use in OCaml 5.0.

I've co-founded several companies 

* [Tarides - France](https://tarides.com/)
* [OCaml Labs Consultancy - UK](http://ocamllabs.io/) _(joined Tarides)_
* [Segfault Systems - India](https://segfault.systems) _(joined Tarides)_

<p/>
to build systems that are _functional_, and functional programming in
[OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) turns out to be a fine choice for this.

I was an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering department
at Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. Prior to that, I was a Senior
Research Associate under the [OCaml
Labs](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs/) initiative at the [University
of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/) [Computer Lab](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/),
an [1851 Research Fellow](http://www.royalcommission1851.org/awards/) and a
Research Fellow at [Darwin College, Cambridge](https://www.darwin.cam.ac.uk/).
Earlier, I was a [graduate student](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/chandras/)
at [Purdue University](http://www.purdue.edu/) where I obtained an MS and a PhD
degree in Computer Science under the supervision of the wonderful [Prof. Suresh
Jagannathan](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/suresh/). Before that, I obtained
my BEng degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [Anna University,
India](https://www.annauniv.edu/).

I write about my research in my [blog](http://kcsrk.info/blog/)
(though not as often as I would like to).
