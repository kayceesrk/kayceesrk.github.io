How does one acquire the fundamental computer skills to hack on a complex
systems project like the OCaml? What's missing and how does one go about
bridging the gap?

<!--more-->

There is a whole lot of fundamental systems skills that goes into working on a
language like OCaml and which only comes with soaking in systems programming. By
systems programming, I mean the ability to do use tools like the command-line,
editors, version control, build systems, compilers, debuggers, bash scripting,
and so on.  This is often something that one takes for granted when working on
such projects, but is often inscrutable for new contributors, who may not have
had the opportunity to develop these skills. I struggle with this in my own
research group, where students approach me to work on the OCaml compiler because
they have studied OS, Compilers and Computer Architecture in class, but once
they understand that working on OCaml involves actually hacking on systems, they
are often lost, and worse, have no idea where to start and how to acquire the
necessary skills.

The CS education in India often lacks a focus on these practical systems skills,
which can make it challenging for new contributors to get involved in systems
programming.  Looking at my own past, my undergraduate CS education, like many
other in India (and potentially elsewhere), had a mandatory OS and Compiler
Construction courses.  But neither had a dedicated lab component. It is natural
that these theoretical courses do not prepare the students for the practical
aspects of systems programming.

I was priviledged to have had a computer at my school, an IBM PC AT Model 5170,
and surprisingly had an education where I did some programming from a very young
age. It was lots of BASIC programming but also just tinkering with the system,
learning how to use DOS, and later Windows 3.1, 95, and so on.  This early
exposure to computers and systems programming gave me a head start.  Many
students, especially those from less priviledged backgrounds, do not have this
early exposure. They may have learned some programming, but not the time to
tinker with systems for extended periods of time. This is a common challenge
faced by professors working in the broad systems area in India. I would be
curious to hear from others about their experiences and how they have addressed
this challenge.

Fortunately, there are resources available online that can help new contributors
acquire these skills. Here are some resources that I have found useful for
working on the OCaml compiler:

+ [MIT Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/): This is a fantastic
resource that covers a wide range of topics related to systems programming,
including command-line tools, version control, editors, and more. The course is
available online for free and includes video lectures, notes, and exercises. I
encourage you to read the [motivation for this
course](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/motivation.html).
+ [Stanford CS45](https://cs45.stanford.edu/):  CS45 is an extended version of
 the MIT course, and will delve into the topics in more detail.
+ [CS3100 Paradigms of Programming](https://github.com/kayceesrk/cs3100_m20):
The course covers a significant chunk of the OCaml language. You should be able
to self-study the course to get a good understanding of the language. That said,
the course deliberately does not cover the build system (dune), package manager
(opam), command-line tools for the compiler (ocamlc, ocamlopt), editor
integration (merlin, ocaml-lsp, ocamlformat), etc.
+ [Real World OCaml](https://realworldocaml.org/): The book has a section on the
compiler and the runtime system, which gives a great overview of the memory
representation, garbage collection, and other aspects of the runtime system.

I will probably keep editing this post as I find more resources. If you have any
suggestions, please feel free to reach out to me.
