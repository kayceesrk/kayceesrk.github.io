Recently, I posted on [X](https://x.com/kc_srk/status/1912008952340164804) and
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kc-sivaramakrishnan-25061a14_kc-sivaramakrishnan-activity-7317777561936183296-8hH-/)
that I am always looking for excellent people to join my group. I received a lot
of enquiries, some of which led to internship hires (yay!). But mostly, I seemed
to offer similar advice. I thought I'd write a post that summarise my responses.

At IIT Madras, my [research group](https://github.com/prismlab) develops
programming language abstractions to solve systems problems. The group is
composed of research associates (fixed-term project staff), PhD, MS and MTech
students, undergraduate research students (who are typically BTech students from
IIT Madars) and interns. I made the following post a few weeks ago, for which I
received a lots of enquiries, and I have been busy writing similar responses to
many of them, which I summarise below.

## Internship positions

Internship enquiries are the most frequent ones that I receive. Here's how you
can make it work.  Please do go through my [web page](https://kcsrk.info) to
look at what areas I work on. Write to me about what interests you and what your
goals are.

My group works on systems. And systems requires that you have demonstrable
systems building experience. Do build projects that go beyond your coursework.
Make sure that the projects are developed publicly on GitHub or other similar
platforms so that one can take a quick look at what you've built. The group
solves systems problems with functional programming. If you have prior
experience with functional programming, such as building small projects with
OCaml, Haskell, Scala, Scheme or other languages, it is easier for me to assess
your interest. That said, if you are great at any programming language, having
built non-trivial projects in any language, then you have the right skills for
internships. Generally, I expect the interns to have done course work on OS,
compilers and computer architecture. Projects in any of those areas is a huge
plus.

I should clarify that my recommendation letters for graduate programs will
reflect my honest assessment of the internship. I will decline writing a
recommendation letter if I think I may not be able to provide a positive one.

I do not work on projects that are primarily AI/ML or Web Development. If you
write to me looking for projects in those areas, it is very likely that you
won't hear from me. Please don't bulk email faculty CCing or BCCing everyone. It
is likely that no one will read such an email.

## PhD/MS/MTech positions

For academic positions, please have a look at https://research.iitm.ac.in/.
There are alternative ways to enter MS and PhD positions by being a reserach
associate and completing some coursework at IITM. For more information, see
[here](https://cystar.iitm.ac.in/join-us/#:~:text=Pathways%20to%20IIT%20Madras).

## Contributing to the OCaml community

A significant chunk of the enquiries were from folks who hold full-time
positions looking to be involved in the research group. Unfortunately, making
part-time positions work is a challenge for both sides. I would encourage
contributions to the wider OCaml community.

There are several great ways to get involved with the community. Here's what I
usually recommend.

* Learn the basics.
  + Go through the OCaml part of my [CS3100 course](https://github.com/kayceesrk/cs3100_m20). The course has a YouTube
  playlist and programming assignments. Complete the programming assignments.
  + Read the [Real World OCaml](https://dev.realworldocaml.org/) book.
  + There are lots of other resources at [OCaml.org](https://ocaml.org/), the official website of the OCaml community and the ecosystem.
* Join the community.
  + OCaml [discord](https://discord.com/invite/ZBgYuvR) and [discuss](https://discuss.ocaml.org/) are great places to hang out with other OCaml folks and ask questions.
  + Discord is better for quick clarifications and discuss for longer form discussions.
* Look for "good first issues" in the OCaml projects and work on them
  + Check out the core platform tools under the [OCaml github org](https://github.com/search?q=label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+language%3AOCaml+state%3Aopen+org%3Aocaml&type=issues). See [OCaml compiler](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22), [dune build system](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22), [opam package manager](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22easy%20first%20issue%22), [ocaml.org](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22), etc.
  + Across the wider ecosystem -- [SemGrep](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22%20), [OpenGrep](https://github.com/opengrep/opengrep/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22), [Rocq](https://github.com/rocq-prover/rocq/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22), etc.
* Work on self-directed projects. Here is my [list of ideas](https://github.com/tarides/hackocaml).

OCaml community also participates in [Outreachy
internships](https://ocaml.org/outreachy). Outreachy internships are paid
internships for underrepresented groups. It is a great way to contribute to the
community while being mentored by folks from the OCaml community. Here's a [nice
intro (in Tamil)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eLRm8riAnI&t=970s) to the
impact that Outreachy program had on an Outreachy intern. Look out for
[announcements](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/outreachy-june-2025/16154) about
Outreachy internships in the OCaml discuss forum.

## Research Associate positions

This is for folks who want to contribute to the core research programme but do
not see themselves joining academic programs. The expectation here is that you
are an experiened systems engineer, who should see themselves easily qualifying
for the internship positions in the group.

One useful way to look at this position is similar to a research software
development engineer who helps build out the systems used for research or
translate research to practice. In the past, research associates have [helped
upstream multicore
OCaml](https://kcsrk.info/ocaml/multicore/job/2019/09/16/1115-multicore-job/).
The easiest way to get into this role would be to do an internship, see whether
you like this area, do well in the internship and then choose to apply to
research associate position.

Another variant is a post-bacc or a pre-doc position aimed at highly motivated
recent graduates, who are looking to build research experience. The expectation
here is that we get papers into top venues in PL and Systems.

Research associate positions are fixed-term positions. In order to make this
work, the tenure should be at least 18 months to make it work.
