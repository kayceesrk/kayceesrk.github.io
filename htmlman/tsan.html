<p>OCaml, since version 5.0, allows shared-memory parallelism and thus mutation of
data shared between multiple threads. This creates the possibility of data
races, i.e., unordered accesses to the same memory location with at least one
of them being a write. In OCaml, data races are easy to introduce, and the
behaviour of programs with data races can be unintuitive — the observed
behaviours cannot be explained by simply interleaving operations from different
concurrent threads. More information about data races and their consequences
can be found in section <a href="parallelism.html#s%3Apar_mm_easy">9.4</a> and Chapter <a href="memorymodel.html#c%3Amemorymodel">10</a>.</p><p>To help detect data races, OCaml supports ThreadSantizer (TSan), a dynamic data
race detector that has been successfully used in languages such as C/C++,
Swift, etc. TSan support for OCaml is available since OCaml 5.2.</p><p>To use TSan, you must configure the compiler with <span class="font-tt">--enable-tsan</span>. You
can also install an <span class="font-tt">opam</span> switch with the TSan feature enabled as
follows:</p><pre>opam switch create &lt;YOUR-SWITCH-NAME-HERE&gt; ocaml-option-tsan
</pre><p>
TSan support for OCaml is currently available for the x86_64 architecture, on
FreeBSD, Linux and macOS, for the arm64 architecture on Linux and macOS, and
for the POWER, riscv and s390x architectures on Linux.</p><p>Building OCaml with TSan support requires GCC or Clang. Minimal supported
versions are GCC 11 and Clang 14. Note that TSan data race reports with GCC 11
are known to result in poor stack trace reporting (no line numbers), which is
fixed in GCC 12.</p><p>A TSan-enabled compiler differs from a regular compiler in the following way:
all programs compiled by <span class="font-tt">ocamlopt</span> are instrumented with calls to the
TSan runtime, and TSan will detect data races encountered during execution.</p><p>For instance, consider the following program:</p><div class="caml-example verbatim">

<div class="ocaml">



<div class="pre caml-input"><span class="ocamlkeyword">let</span> a = <span class="ocamlkeyword">ref</span> 0 <span class="ocamlkeyword">and</span> b = <span class="ocamlkeyword">ref</span> 0

<span class="ocamlkeyword">let</span> d1 () =
  a := 1;
  !b

<span class="ocamlkeyword">let</span> d2 () =
  b := 1;
  !a

<span class="ocamlkeyword">let</span> () =
  <span class="ocamlkeyword">let</span> h = Domain.spawn d2 <span class="ocamlkeyword">in</span>
  <span class="ocamlkeyword">let</span> r1 = d1 () <span class="ocamlkeyword">in</span>
  <span class="ocamlkeyword">let</span> r2 = Domain.join h <span class="ocamlkeyword">in</span>
  <span class="ocamlkeyword">assert</span> (not (r1 = 0 &amp;&amp; r2 = 0))</div></div>

</div><p>This program has data races. The memory locations <span class="font-tt">a</span> and <span class="font-tt">b</span>
are read and written concurrently by multiple domains <span class="font-tt">d1</span> and
<span class="font-tt">d2</span>. <span class="font-tt">a</span> and <span class="font-tt">b</span> are “non-atomic” locations according
to the memory model (see Chapter <a href="memorymodel.html#c%3Amemorymodel">10</a>), and there is no
synchronization between accesses to them. Hence, there are two data races here
corresponding to the two memory locations <span class="font-tt">a</span> and <span class="font-tt">b</span>.</p><p>When you compile and run this program with <span class="font-tt">ocamlopt</span>, you may observe
data race reports on the standard error, such as:</p><pre>==================

==================
ThreadSanitizer: reported 2 warnings
</pre><p>
For each detected data race, TSan reports the location of the conflicting
accesses, their nature (read, write, atomic read, etc.), and the associated
stack trace.</p><p>If you run the above program several times, the output may vary: sometimes TSan
will report two data races, sometimes one, and sometimes none. This is due to
the combination of two factors:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">First, TSan reports only the data races encountered during execution,
i.e., conflicting, unordered memory accesses that are effectively performed.
</li><li class="li-itemize">In addition, in this program, depending on executions, there may be no
such memory accesses: if <span class="font-tt">d1</span> returns before <span class="font-tt">d2</span> has
finished spawning, then all memory accesses originating from <span class="font-tt">d1</span>
may happen-before the ones originating from <span class="font-tt">d2</span>, since spawning a
domain involves inter-thread synchronization. In that case, the accesses
are considered to be ordered and no data race is reported.
</li></ul><p>This example illustrates the fact that data races can sometimes be hidden by
unrelated synchronizing operations.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="s:tsan-performance"><a class="section-anchor" href="#s:tsan-performance" aria-hidden="true">﻿</a>27.2 Performance implications</h2>
<p>TSan instrumentation imposes a non-negligible cost at runtime. Empirically,
this cost has been observed to cause a slowdown which can range from 2x to 7x.
One of the main factors of high slowdowns is frequent access to mutable data.
In contrast, the initialising writes to and reads from immutable memory
locations are not instrumented. TSan also allocates very large amounts of virtual
memory, although it uses only a fraction of it. The memory consumption is
increased by a factor between 4 and 7.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="s:tsan-false-neg-false-pos"><a class="section-anchor" href="#s:tsan-false-neg-false-pos" aria-hidden="true">﻿</a>27.3 False negatives and false positives</h2>
<p>As illustrated by the previous example, TSan will only report the data races
encountered during execution. Another important caveat is that TSan remembers
only a finite number of memory accesses per memory location. At
the time of writing, this number is 4. Data races involving a forgotten access
will not be detected. Lastly, the
<a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerAlgorithm">documentation
of TSan</a> states that there is a tiny probability to miss a race if two threads
access the same location at the same time. TSan may overlook data races only 
in these three specific cases.</p><p>For data races between two memory accesses made from OCaml code, TSan does not
produce false positives; that is, TSan will not emit spurious reports.</p><p>When mixing OCaml and C code, through the use of C primitives, the very notion
of false positive becomes less clear, as it involves two memory models – OCaml
and C11.
However, TSan should behave mostly as one would expect: non-atomic reads and
writes in C will race with non-atomic reads and writes in OCaml, and C atomics
will not race with OCaml atomics. There is one theoretical possibility of false
positive: if a <span class="font-tt">value</span> is initialized from C without using
<span class="font-tt">caml_initialize</span> (which is allowed under the condition that the GC does
not run between the allocation and the write, see Chapter <a href="intfc.html#c%3Aintf-c">22</a>) and a
conflicting access is made later by another thread. This does not constitute a
data race, but TSan may report it as such.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="s:tsan-runtime-flags"><a class="section-anchor" href="#s:tsan-runtime-flags" aria-hidden="true">﻿</a>27.4 Runtime options</h2>
<p>TSan supports a number of configuration options at runtime using the
<span class="font-tt">TSAN_OPTIONS</span> environment variable. <span class="font-tt">TSAN_OPTIONS</span> should
contain one or more options separated by spaces. See the
<a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerFlags">documentation
of TSan flags</a> and the
<a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/SanitizerCommonFlags">documentation
of flags common to all sanitizers</a> for more information. Notably,
<span class="font-tt">TSAN_OPTIONS</span> allows suppressing some data races from TSan reports.
Suppressing data race reports is useful for intentional races or libraries that
cannot be fixed.</p><p>For example, to suppress reports originating from functions in the OCaml module
<span class="font-tt">My_module</span>, one can run</p><pre>TSAN_OPTIONS="suppressions=suppr.txt" ./my_instrumented_program
</pre><p>
with <span class="font-tt">suppr.txt</span> a file containing:</p><pre>race_top:^camlMy_module
</pre><p>
(Note that this depends on the format of OCaml symbols in the executable. Some
builders, like Dune, might result in different formats. You should adapt this
example to the symbols effectively present in your stack traces.)</p><p>The <span class="font-tt">TSAN_OPTIONS</span> variable also allows for increasing the “history
size”, e.g.:</p><pre>TSAN_OPTIONS="history_size=7" ./my_instrumented_program
</pre><p>
TSan’s history records events such as function entry and exit, and is used to
reconstruct stack traces. Increasing the history size can sometimes be
necessary to obtain the second stack trace, but it also increases memory
consumption. This setting does not change the number of memory accesses
remembered per memory location.</p><p>Another useful runtime option is <span class="font-tt">exitcode=0</span>, which still reports data
races but does not change the exit code. This can be useful if TSan complains
about data races in programs that you don’t care about and the non-zero exit
code disturbs your workflow.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="s:tsan-c-code"><a class="section-anchor" href="#s:tsan-c-code" aria-hidden="true">﻿</a>27.5 Guidelines for linking</h2>
<p>As a general rule, OCaml programs instrumented with TSan should only be linked
with OCaml or C objects also instrumented with TSan. Doing otherwise may result
in crashes. The only exception to this rule are C libraries that do not call
into the OCaml runtime system in any way, i.e., do not allocate, raise
exceptions, call back into OCaml code, etc. Examples include the libc or system
libraries. Data races in non-instrumented libraries will not be reported.</p><p>C code interacting with OCaml should always be built through the
<span class="font-tt">ocamlopt</span> command, which will pass the required instrumentation flags
to the C compiler. The <span class="font-tt">CAMLno_tsan</span> qualifier can be used to prevent
functions from being instrumented:</p><pre>CAMLno_tsan void f(int arg)
{
  /* This function will not be instrumented. */
  ...
}
</pre><p>
Races from non-instrumented functions will not be reported.
<span class="font-tt">CAMLno_tsan</span> should only be used by experts. It can be used to reduce
the performance overhead in certain corner cases, or to suppress some known
alarms. For the latter, using a suppressions file with <span class="font-tt">TSAN_OPTIONS</span>
should be preferred when possible, as it allows for finer-grained control, and
qualifying a function <span class="font-tt">f</span> with <span class="font-tt">CAMLno_tsan</span> results in missing
entries in TSan’s stack traces when a data race happens in a transitive callee
of <span class="font-tt">f</span>.</p><p>There is no way to disable instrumentation in OCaml code.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="s:tsan-signal-changes"><a class="section-anchor" href="#s:tsan-signal-changes" aria-hidden="true">﻿</a>27.6 Changes in the delivery of signals</h2>
<p>TSan intercepts all signals and passes them down to the instrumented program.
This overlay from TSan is not always transparent for the program. Synchronous
signals such as <span class="font-tt">SIGSEV</span>, <span class="font-tt">SIGILL</span>, <span class="font-tt">SIGBUS</span>, etc. will be
passed down immediately, whereas asynchronous signals such as <span class="font-tt">SIGINT</span>
will be delayed until the next call to the TSan runtime (e.g. until the next
access to mutable data). This limitation of TSan can have surprising effects:
for instance, pure, recursive functions that do not allocate cannot be
interrupted until they terminate.
