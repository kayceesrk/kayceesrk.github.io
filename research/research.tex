In recent years, there has been a widespread adoption of both multicore and
cloud computing. Multicore processors have become the norm in mobile, desktop
and enterprise computing, with an increasing number of cores being fitted on a
chip with every successive generation. Cloud computing has paved the way for
companies to rent farms of such multicore processors on a pay-per-use basis,
with the ability to dynamically scale on demand. Indeed, many real-world
services for communication, governance, commerce, education, entertainment,
etc., are routinely exposed as a web-service that runs in third-party cloud
compute platforms such as Windows Azure and Amazon's EC2. These services tend
to be concurrently accessed by millions of users, increasingly through
multicore-capable mobile and desktop devices.

As a result, there are a growing proportion of developers who must tackle the
complexity of programming for a cloud of multicore processors. In particular,
they must ensure correct application behavior in the face of asynchrony,
concurrency, and partial failures, all the while providing good scalability as
well as minimizing the user's perception of latency. Reasoning about concurrent
programs is inherently a difficult endeavor. For each new concurrent thread of
control added to a program, there is an exponential growth in the number of
potential schedules. This greatly increases the chance of subtle concurrency
bugs evading the programmer during software development and testing, only to
appear in production environments with devastating consequences. As we head
into multicore compute platforms with 1000+ cores, the existing ad hoc
programming models and systems are simply not equipped for safe and scalable
concurrent programming, where the emerging concerns such as heterogeneity in
hardware, partial failures of cores, and secure computation with third-party
code and infrastructure warrant a holistic approach to software development.

The goal of my current research is to improve the state of the art in
developing correct and scalable programs for loosely coupled massively scalable
systems through rigorous and declarative programming language abstractions.
While I am broadly interested in concurrency and parallelism, I am particularly
drawn to architecture-induced complexities such as absence of cache coherence
and eventual consistency, which often lead to programs where the guarantee of
correctness and concision take a back seat to performance. I aim to address
several key challenges crosscutting disparate domains, such as (i) developing
concurrent programming platforms to enable building applications that
seamlessly scale on heterogeneous compute clouds, (ii) rigorously verifying the
correctness of parallel and distributed software, to eliminate concurrency and
security bugs, which are notoriously difficult to detect in large-scale
deployments, and (iii) incorporating emerging concerns such as security and
energy into the programming model.

\section*{Previous Work}

Towards this goal, as a part of my PhD thesis, I have developed the MultiMLton
platform, a parallel and distributed extension of MLton Standard ML compiler
and runtime, which has been part of several successful research
projects~\cite{mmpar, mmgc, KC_MARC12, Ziarek11, Ziarek_ICFP09, isolates,
MMJFP}. My work on MultiMLton has been recognized by Purdue University with the
2014 Maurice H. Halstead award for outstanding research in Software Engineering
and a best paper award at the 2012 Many-core Architecture Research Community
(MARC) symposium at RWTH Aachen. The goal of MultiMLton is to allow the
programmer to declaratively develop concurrent programs, without worrying about
the issues of architectural nuances and achieving good scalability. There are
numerous challenges to realizing these goals, some of which I have addressed as
a part of my PhD research.

\R{Programming model} The programming model of MultiMLton
is a mostly functional language combined with lightweight threading, where
threads primarily interact over first-class message-passing channels. On
manycore systems, the cost of creating and managing interactive asynchronous
computations can be substantial due to the scheduler and memory management
overheads. My work in JFP'14~\cite{MMJFP} and DAMP'10~\cite{mmpar} describes a
novel \emph{parasitic} threading system for short-lived interactive
asynchronous computation. The key feature of parasitic threads is that they
execute only when attached to a host lightweight thread, sharing the stack
space, and hence amortizing the overheads. In MultiMLton, parasitic threads
play a key role in the efficient realization of composable asynchronous and
heterogeneous communication protocols~\cite{Ziarek11}.

\R{Programming next-generation many-core processors} With ever increasing core
count on a chip, processors are soon to hit a "coherence wall", where the
performance and design complexity of cache coherence hardware limits multicore
scalability. Architectures, such as Intel's 48-core Single-chip Cloud Computer
(SCC), completely shun hardware cache coherence, and instead, provide fast
hardware message-passing interconnect and the ability to manage coherence in
software. Although a shared memory system, SCC is typically programmed as a
cluster of machines on a chip, due to the lack of suitable abstractions to deal
with absence of cache coherence. The question is whether we can program this
\emph{cloud} of cores on a chip in the way we program shared-memory multicore
processors. Such a system will greatly simplify developing programs for the
massively scalable SCC processor.

My ISMM'12~\cite{mmgc} work describes a novel runtime system for MultiMLton,
which utilizes a core-local partitioned heap scheme to circumvent the absence
of cache coherence. This runtime system not only enables shared memory
programming of non-cache-coherent systems, but by enabling concurrent
core-local heap collections, exhibits immense scalability benefits even on
cache-coherent architectures such as 48-core AMD magny-cours and 864-core Azul
Vega3 architectures. My MARC'12~\cite{KC_MARC12} work describes an extension of
this design to exploit software support for cache coherence and hardware
interconnect for inter-thread message passing. Across our benchmarks, we
measured that this new runtime system design enables more than 99\% of the
memory access to be potentially cached. This work won the \loud{Best Paper
Award} at MARC'12.

\R{Migrating to the cloud} MultiMLton programming model combines the
benefit of functional programming with synchronous message passing, and offers
an attractive model for expressing concurrency. However, in a high-latency
environment like the cloud, the synchrony is at odds with high latency, whereas
switching to an explicit asynchronous programming model complicates reasoning.
The question is whether we can express programs for high-latency environments
\emph{synchronously}, but speculatively discharge them asynchronously, and
ensure that the observable behavior mirrors that of the original synchronous
program. My PADL'14~\cite{RxCML} work identified that the necessary and
sufficient condition for divergent behavior (mis-speculation) is the presence
of happens-before cycle in the dependence relation between communication
actions. Utilizing this idea, I have built an optimistic concurrency control
mechanism for concurrent ML programs, on top of MultiMLton, capable of running
in compute clouds. Our extensive experiments on Amazon EC2 validate our thesis
that this technique is quite useful in practice.

Apart from my PhD research, I have the opportunity to explore the questions
relating to concurrent programming for multicore systems during my internships
with industrial research labs. At Microsoft Research Cambridge, I have
developed a new concurrency substrate for Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), that
allows Haskell programmers to safely and composably describe schedulers for
Haskell threads in Haskell on scalable multi-core architectures~\cite{CompSA}.
At Samsung Research, I prototyped the compiler analysis and the runtime system
for new clean-slate manycore programming language~\cite{SPARTA}. These
experiences have provided me insights into the issues are faced by developers
in today's parallel compute systems, and also the necessary expertise to
realize my ideas in complex, real-world software platforms.

\section*{Current Work}

After finishing my PhD~\cite{thesis} at Purdue University, I joined University
of Cambridge as a Research Associate under the OCaml Labs initiative where I
continue to explore the development of concurrent and parallel functional
programming language systems. I lead the Multicore OCaml project which aims to
add concurrent and parallel programming support for the industrial strength
OCaml programming language.

A particularly distinguishing feature of this effort is that instead of baking
the concurrency support into the compiler and exposing libraries for concurrent
programming, we extend OCaml with support for lineaer algebraic effects and
handlers~\cite{effects}. Algebraic effects and handlers provide a modular
abstraction for expressing effectful computation, allowing the programmer to
separate the expression of an effectful computation from its implementation. In
this system, concurrency is just another effect, modularly expressed through
algebraic effects and their handlers. This design allows the programmer to
describe thread schedulers and concurrent data structures as OCaml libraries,
keeping the compiler lean, while providing the flexibility of swapping in
alternate but equivalent implementations. Given that OCaml has an excellent
Javascript backend~\cite{js_of_ocaml}, the addition of concurrency support to
OCaml has the potential to greatly simplify the implementation of
highly-concurrent real-world web-services.

\section*{Future Work}

In my future work, I wish to build on the MultiMLton programming model to
address the emerging and future challenges in programming manycore and
large-scale distributed clusters. Nowadays, an increasing number of companies
deploy their web-services on geo-distributed third-party cloud platforms such
as Amazon EC2, Windows Azure, Heroku, Google App Engine, etc. These cloud
platforms are becoming more heterogenous incorporating many-core
general-purpose processors (potentially with multiple \emph{coherence domains})
with GPGPUs and FPGAs, providing the ability to offload expensive computation
to specialized hardware. Traditionally, developers have relied on the
infrastructure providing strong consistency guarantees such as sequential
consistency, linearizability and distributed transactions in order to build
correct applications for scalable platforms. Strong consistency provides a
semblance of a single consistent view of memory, where the operations appear to
be performed sequentially in some linear order. Unfortunately, providing such
strong guarantees in unviable in the face of modern multicore processors and
geo-distributed massively scalable services.

Modern multicore processors and concurrent programming languages expose subtle
relaxed memory behaviors that arise from hardware and compiler optimizations
to the developer. The state of the art distributed stores also resort to weak
consistency guarantees, where the different geo-distributed replicas eventually
converge to a uniform state at some arbitrary point in the future. In
particular, no assumptions can be made about the global state of the system at
any particular time. Such weakly consistent systems make a well-known
trade-off: developers avoid the cost associated with latency, contention and
availability to achieve strong consistency, in exchange for weaker consistency
guarantees about the data; the semblance of a uniform consistent view of memory
is lost. Additionally, since the web applications run on third-party compute
platforms, the issue of data privacy and security has also become a concern. In
the cloud, an application typically shares resources such as disk, network and
processor time with applications from other customers, running on the same
server. Since critical services such as health-care and banking services are
increasingly offered online, any vulnerability in the software in such an
environment could lead to a potentially serious security breach. Existing
programming models for these platforms are ill-equipped to address these
consistency and security challenges.

To address these issues, I have developed Quelea~\cite{quelea}, a rigorous
programming model that elegantly combines shared-memory parallelism with
datacenter-wide distribution. Quelea programming model is exposed as a
domain-specific language for describing the semantics of replicated datatypes
in the same vein as abstract datatypes, along with a novel contract language
for declaratively expressing the consistency and security obligations. This
clean separation of consistency and security properties from the datatype
semantics permits the same program to be compiled for a variety of backends
including multicore processors and distributed stores.

A key aim of Quelea is to remain portable and agnostic to any particular
implementation. The developers describe what minimal consistency guarantees are
required for the application, but not how to achieve them, which is the concern
of individual backend implementations. The separation of consistency concerns
and datatype semantics allows Quelea to be realized as a shim layer on top of a
wide variety of eventually consistent data stores. The stores provide
availability, durability and distribution guarantees, while our system simply
upgrades the safety properties. This layered approach is geared towards
interoperability and broad applicability, providing clearer semantics and
stronger safety properties for existing software systems.

The declarative description of safety properties in Quelea lends itself to
rigorous formal verification of distributed software, eliminating bugs and
vulnerabilities prior to deployment, preventing privacy and monetary losses
associated with software bugs in the wild. I intend to build Quelea on top of
the highly successful Mirage Unikernel, which is part XenServer and Linux
Foundation, with millions of deployments in the cloud already. Mirage project
is led from the Cambridge Computer Lab, where I have chosen to pursue my
post-doctoral research. A symbiotic relationship with Mirage will help rapid
adoption of Quelea, and greatly impact the way in which cloud services are
built and deployed.
